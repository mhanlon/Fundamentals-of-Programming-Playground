# Logo.playground Read Me

This playground is meant for teaching the fundamentals of computer programming using a Logo-like approach.

You can clone this repo to your local machine and then Airdrop the playgroundbook onto your iPad with Swift Playgrounds.

It's intended to be used with my course, Fundamentals of Programming, but I *think* you could probably follow along at home without me blabbering at you.

You can download a little helper for degrees and a Logo command reference from http://www.wickedpearprogramming.com/w/resources/, but, since the Logo commands I've implemented in Swift are a little different you're probably better off referring to the help and hints in the playground book.

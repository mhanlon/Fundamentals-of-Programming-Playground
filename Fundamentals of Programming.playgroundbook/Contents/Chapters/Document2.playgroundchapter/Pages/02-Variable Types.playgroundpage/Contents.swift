 **Goal:** Learn about variable types
 
 In Swift, variables are said to be of a certain type. You can think of it like a box, meant to hold a specific thing. Like a hat box would hold hats. Or a vase would hold flowers.
 
 Swift tries to be helpful and makes the box the right size and shape for the very first thing you put in it.

var name = "Your Name"
var mealsADay = 3
var favoriteFood = "pizza"

var firstNumber = 9
var secondNumber = 4

//: But if you don't know what, exactly, you're going to put into a variable first, you have to help Swift out a little bit.

var answer: Int


answer = 4+3

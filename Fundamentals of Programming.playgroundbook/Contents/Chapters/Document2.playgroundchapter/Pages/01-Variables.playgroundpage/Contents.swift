 **Goal:** Learn about variables
 
 A [variable](glossary://variable) is a little like a box in which you want to store something to use again later.
 
 And what you store in your variables is going to vary depending what you're doing with your code.
 
 If your program is a math program or a calculator, you might remember a series of numbers. If your program is a shopping list, you might need to remember a series of words for the items you need to buy.

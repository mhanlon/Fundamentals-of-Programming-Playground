 **Goal:** Draw a line.
 
 It's important, for computers, to tell it to do something in a certain order.
 
 Computers, through programming languages, typically understand a limited set of specific instructions. In the case of this lesson, our computer understands one command:
 * `forward(`*some number*`)`
 
 Let's use that command to draw a line.

 Does a little red dot show up? We'll talk more about that in [a future lesson](06-Debugging).

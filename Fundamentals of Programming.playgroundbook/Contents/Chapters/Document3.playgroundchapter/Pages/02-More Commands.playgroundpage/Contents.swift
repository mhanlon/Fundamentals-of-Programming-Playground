 **Goal:** Learn some more commands.
 
 One command all on its own isn't too exciting, so let's add a few more. Our code can now call three more commands:
 * `forward(`*some number*`)`
 * `backward(`*some number*`)`
 * `right(`*some number*`)`
 * `left(`*some number*`)`
 
 Let's draw a line.

    turtle.right(turnDegrees: Float(degrees))

forward(/*#-editable-code*/100/*#-end-editable-code*/)
//: And then we can turn right, in degrees.
right(/*#-editable-code*/90/*#-end-editable-code*/)
//: And go forward 100 steps again.
forward(/*#-editable-code*/100/*#-end-editable-code*/)

/*:
 Because we turned 90 degrees, when we draw a line forward again it angles away from our first line.

// Once you've set some commands, you need to add it to our ViewController. So let's create a view controller for our live view...
let vc = TurtleViewController()
// : We can even set the speed at which our turtle draws our commands...
vc.setSpeed(Speed.normal)
// And then add our turtle to that view controller.

/*:
 **Goal:** Draw a line.
 
 This playground is designed to introduce you to some commands you can use to draw some lines, make some turns. It's important, for computers, to tell it to do something in a certain order.
 
 Computers, through programming languages, typically understand a limited set of specific instructions. In the case of this lesson, our computer understands one command:
 * `forward(`*some number*`)`
 
 Let's use that command to draw a line.

 Try changing that number `100` to some other number.

 Does a little red dot show up? We'll talk more about that in a future lesson.

 **Goal:** Use a loop to make a square.
 
 Computers are excellent at doing repetitive tasks. For example, in our previous lesson, we drew a square. One way to draw a square is to go forward a certain number of steps, turn right, go forward a certain number of steps, turn right, go forward a certain number of steps, turn right, then go forward a certain number of steps. Like so:
 ```
 forward(100)
 right(90)
 forward(100)
 right(90)
 forward(100)
 right(90)
 forward(100)
 right(90)
 ```
 
 What lines are repeated? How many times are they repeated?
 
 In Swift, if we want the computer to do something 4 times we use a `for` loop. Like this:
 
 ```
 for _ in 1...4 {
 <your code here>
 }
 ```
 Try filling out the code in the loop to draw a square without repeating lines.
